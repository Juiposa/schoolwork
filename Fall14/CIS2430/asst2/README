Assignment 2 for CIS 2430

Day Planner; Java program

Terminal based day planner

Complilation
-------------------------

A Makefile has been used.
To compile both the program and the javadoc, navigate to the directory in terminal and simply type:

"make" 

The javadoc is located inthe folder called "javadoc" and can be opened by opening the file "index.html" with any web browser or using an IDE

To run the program, from the main directory type:

"java asst2.DayPlanner"

Test plan
------------------------

Parts of the program where user input is taken, giving it gibberish and input deliberately out of range was how it was test and robustness was improved.
