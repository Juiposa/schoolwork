How to Run
---------------------

To compile, navigate to source directory and type:

'make'

This will compile each program

Then to run either type
'./bin/q1'
'./bin/q2'

Running q2 will be described further later


Sample Output and Program Function
------------------------------------------

Question 1)

When you start the program you are presented with a list of choices:

Choose an option:
1) add a new car to the available to rent list
2) add a returned car to the avialable to rent list
3) add a returned car to the repair list
4) transfer a car from the repair list to the available to rent list
5) rent the first avialable car
6) print all the lists
7) quit

Selecting any one of these options will executed the command and may or may not ask for addition input.

---
1) add a new car to the available to rent list

You will be presented with this.

'Enter a plate number followed by the car's odometer.'

After which you would enter data, looking like this

'Enter a plate number followed by the car's odometer.'
'BVKJ764'
'16004'

After which the car with platenumber BVKJ764 with an odometer at 16004km will be added to the available to rent list

---
2) add a returned car to the available to rent list

You would be presented with a message asking for the car's platenumber, then the return mileage, and a total for the trip would be calculated
looking like this:

'What is the plate number of the car?
AB39807
What is the mileage after return?
46031
Total charge for trip: $40.00'

---
3) add a returned car to the repair list
Will look identical to the above. An extra operation the user does not see will be executed to move the car to the repair list instead of the 
available list.

---
4) transfer a car from the repair list to the available to rent list
Will simply ask for a plate number and complete the operation of moving that car to the available list

---
5) rent the first avialable car

User will be asked for the car's expected return date:

'When is the car expected back? (ddmmyyyy)'
'22112014'

The first car on the available to rent list will then be dispatched.

---
6) print all the lists

To see the lists, select 6, wherein all lists will be printed
For example:

Available to rent list.
Car; Platenumber: BVKJ764; Odometer: 16004
Car; Platenumber: BAWM390; Odometer: 154698
Car; PlateNumber: AKHJ871; Odometer: 301254

Rented list.
Car; Platenumber: AB39807; Odometer: 45980; Expected return date: 22102014

Cars being repaired.
Car; Platenumber: BHJV341; Odometer: 18754

Not much more to that.

---
7) quit

Well... quit.

---------------------------------
Question 2

User will input at the command line

Entering the equation you wish to evaluate as the first and only command line argument

'./bin/q2 23+34++'

I've not even started this.

The string is parsed at each level of the binary tree this will be broken up into. 
At the first level, the operation being done is determined and the two operands parsed. 
In this case the operation is "+" and the two operands "23+" and "34+"
As both operands are not the single digit numbers we can work with, we branch the tree further downward.
The repective operations are determined along with their operands. In this case
"+", "2", and "3"; and "+", "3", and "4."

Since we now have single digit operands, we evaluate the equations. Getting "5" and "7" respectively.

With these operands determined, we go up a level in the tree and complete the operation there. Resulting in "12"

We branch the tree as much as we need to to get basic single digit operands.
