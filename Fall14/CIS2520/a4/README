How to run
-------------------

To compile, navigate to the main directory of the program, that is where 'Makefile' is stored, and type:
'make'

To run, again from the main directory, type:
'./bin/avltree'


notes
-------------------
Nothing really to tell

Except that my balancing algo is a bit weird. It implements cut/link, but to get a properly balanced tree, I have to loop through six times. Weird. 
It does balanced the tree properly though, so that's good. :D

The example data file is included as well.
