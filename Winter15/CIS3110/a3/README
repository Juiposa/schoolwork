to compile simply type 'make'

executables are found in bin/ under the required names


I did very little for part 1. It links and compiles and I did a bit of messing around learning pthreads.
What I have is there.

For Part 2 -

I used two data structures to handle memory.

A static array to keep track of inidividual megabytes and if they were occupied or not, and a series of queues for processes
waiting to be loaded, processes in memory, and processes that had finished completing ( swapped out for a third time )

The processes would be swapped between these queues as needed, at the same time updating thier range in memory accordingly.

There is not much else I subjectively did. Everything with regard to picking holes I did to the definition of the strategies
and assignment. 

I did not implement next fit, 'cause I'm a lazy bum. 

Have a good day.
