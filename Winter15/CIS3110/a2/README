The simulator operates at all times under in an assumed Round Robin fashion. Conditionals that acutally carry RR fucntionality
are bound to if the quantum has been set or not. If the quantum is not set the algorithm will run, finger quotes, Round Robin, as if it the
quantum was infinite.

Switch overhead is very static and is only ever considered when a thread is being switched out of running. At that point, a static value
is added to the switch ticker, which counts down to 0, allowing a new thread to be pulled from the ready queue. 

i) Overhead is included for the very first thread. The first thread will only enter running state once the switch ticker is 0.

ii) If the CPU remains idle for the duration of the switch overhead, any thread that enters the ready afterwards queue will be immediately set 
to running without overhead. 

iii) Switch overhead is always added, regardless if the ready queue is empty or not.

iv) Like above, overhead is included always, even if the thread gets to keep processing.

I know. I could fix these, but I'm lazy. :P

Have a great day!
