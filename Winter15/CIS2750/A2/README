BEFORE EXECUTION: enter command 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:bin/' 
from program's main directory

Simply type 'make' to compile.

To run type 'java -cp bin/ gui.Dialogc'

Information:

See javadoc for class descriptions, C stuff is in header files in include/

Buttons are as follows:
New, Open, Save, SaveAs as straightforward and easily recognisable.
Compile is the button with the arrows rotating.
Run is the play button.
Stop is the stop sign, and will kill the active test window.

Compile and Run is under the Compile menu.


Known issues and what I've left out:

There is no keyboard acceleration. Sorry :(

C *sometimes* (note: only when there are syntax errors in the file) causes Java 
to freak out, and will do so in situations it shouldn't otherwise; like multiple
passes of the parser over the exact same file will cause issues with the JVM some
times but not others. It stopped happening towards the end of development, but I 
can't guarantee it doesn't happen anymore. Damn JNI.

ActionListeners and Data types for buttons and fields respectively aren't used 
in any way. Buttons simply print their action command to the status area and 
accessors and mutators for fields use strings only.

Just incase, do not touch anything dat/, please, pretty please.

And thats it. I hope you don't get too bored marking. Have a good day!
