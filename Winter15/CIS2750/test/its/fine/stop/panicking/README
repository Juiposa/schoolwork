Everything works now! Yay!

Once the script is done installing, just find your way to the bin folder and type 'java Dialogc'

Make sure the working directory is set to the directory the testing folders are in. As in whatever
directory 'test1', 'test2' et cetera are in. Dialogc will plop compiled files into the correct folder.

That's it. Horray!
