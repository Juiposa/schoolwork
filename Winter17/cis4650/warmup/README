SGML Scanner

This is a scanner for Standard Generalized Markup Language. It will check if open
and closed tags are properly paired and will also tokenise and output relevant
information.

To build, type "make". To clean build, type "make clean" and then "make" again.

To run, type "./scanner < input.txt", where "input.txt" is the SGML file you want
the scanner to check.
