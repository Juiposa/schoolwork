SGML Scanner

Jeffrey-David Kapp 0832671

This is a scanner for Standard Generalized Markup Language. It will check if open
and closed tags are properly paired and will also tokenise and output relevant
information.

To build, type "make". To clean build, type "make clean" and then "make" again.

To run, type "./scanner < input.txt", where "input.txt" is the SGML file you want
the scanner to check.

Possible improvement that could be made is including some of the fucntionality in
the main program loop into an customised stack class that inherits from std::stack.

TESTING:

In the file test.txt found in the main directory is a series of tests I used
to test the robustness of my regexs, stack, and program in general. With regards
to the regex, I was making sure that all possible fringe cases were covered and
resulted in correct output. The APOSTROPHIZED, HYPHENATED and NUMBER are the ones
most tested as they have the most elaborate regexs.
