Learned basic xml concepts from:
http://feinan.com/2011/09/29/parsing-xhtml-in-c-%E2%80%93-a-libxml2-tutorial/

And made heavy reference to the libxml2 documentation and API:
http://www.xmlsoft.org/html/index.html

As well, got help from Ricky Break, Trevor Thompson and Nick Beirne in understanding libxml2 better.
